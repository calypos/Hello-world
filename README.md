# Hello-world
Start of my coding training hours
I am doing this because I have survived five strokes to date. I am 36 years old and computers saved my life when I had my first two strokes. I am struggling with the fact that I now have to live on disability, its not enough and paying the bills is definatly hard sometimes. However my idea is this to learn code. Help a non profit organization at the same time and so forth so that I can be part of a productive person with in this society. My nephew learned on his own and is now working with Mercades and just bought annew car and loves his life. I want to be that way myself. Only there is another part of me that wants to help the medical community. So with this being said thank you for allowing me time to learn how to code and I hope that I work well with this program so that I can be productive in the futhure.
